    Extract the take real time data of job description of job profiles that are around similar skills that the resume has and also match the years of experience that tge candidate hold. Out of all the job profiles that you find out, prioritise on the job titles for companies that are in the similar industry as the candidate's previous companies mentioned in the resume.
    
    Based on the above steps, tell me the years of experience of the resume and suggest Top 3 job profiles that suits the resume and the level of preparedness of my resume for each profile.
    Follow below instruction while generating result:-
    
    I just need Job profiles and level of Preparedness for each Job profiles as either Fully-Prepared, Prepared, or Needs-Preparation.
    Note that interview selection rate is only 25%.
    Fully-Prepared defination:- Chances are more than 90 % that the candidate will crack interview.
    Prepared:- Chances are more then 60 % but less than 90% that candidate will crack interview.
    Needs-Preparation:- chances are less then 60 percent.
    
    If I am currently studying somewhere, then treat me as a fresher and only suggest entry level job profile as my years of experience will be zero.
    Otherwise, calculate the total relevent years of experience as the sum of year of experience of each full time job profiles in my resume.
    
    Your job profile suggestions should take into account the total years of experience of the resume and compare with the industry standard job profile. You can also look for job profiles with labels such as junior, senior, associate, lead keywords according to the relevent years of experience.
    
    After calculating years of experience for the candidate, follow below rules:-
    If the candidate is a fresher or having years of experience less than 1 year, give more priority to projects, Internship, certificates for suggesting job profile.
    If the candidate is a fresher, understand the project very deeply like tools used, technology used, concept used, and the project is relevent to which industry.
    Also, give more weightage to job profiles suggestions for which the candidate has any relevant certification done.
    
    Remember:- It is not necessary to give atleast one job profile for which the resume is fully suited. You should have a standard universal scale for marking all the resumes.
    
    While putting associate, senior, lead, junior, manager, consultant or similar prefix in a job profile compare the relevent years of experience required for the job profile from real time data and compare with the experience in the resume.
    
    Remember to categoriz each job profile preparedness on the same scale.
    You can read all the research or studies done in real time data available on internet to solve this problem.
    
    Always consider all factor like personal project, work description, skills, industry based projects, concepts covered, certification, tools while categorization on behalf of preparedness.
    
    Take real time data of Professionals from linkledln or Naukri profiles and see their employees to predict the job profiles more efficiently for me.
    Also, suggest job profiles from all industries and any size of companies and not necessarily from tech.
